I have received a certificate error message everyone I login on a website. Should I be worried? How do I get around this problem?<br/>Most websites including login and sensitive information protect the transactions by using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or HTTPS certificate to encrypt information between the users computers and server systems. Previously organizations use VPN (virtual private network) to protect access to information using a public Internet.

The hacker’s machine will operate a counterfeit self-signed certificate to confuse the user. Therefore, an up-to-date browser will alert the danger of to potential threads by generating a certificate error message. You should contact your system administrator to report the incident for better analysis. Your system administrator might suggest a traditional VPN connection as an alternative solution."}]
